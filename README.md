# Nice Connectives

Here is a problem which might be computer solvable with Z3.

## Setup

It concerns classical two-valued connectives of any adicity.
Call a set of connectives nice if it is complete (every classical connective is definable from it) and if it is independent (no connective in the set is definable from the other connectives in the set).

## Question

What is the largest size of a nice set?
One can show it is at most 16.
One can also show that if the connectives are required to be binary, then the largest size is 3.
But what if the connectives are allowed to have 3 argument-places or 4 or more?

## Notes

The problem is not completely combinatorial but it has a combinatorial element (since one can always consider definitions up to a certain size).
