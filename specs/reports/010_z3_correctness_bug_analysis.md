# Z3 Correctness Bug Analysis Report

## Metadata
- **Report Number**: 010
- **Date**: 2025-10-02
- **Scope**: Root cause analysis of Z3 independence checking bug
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - Z3 produces incorrect results for binary search
- **Status**: Bug identified, root cause confirmed

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL BUG**: Z3 SAT backend produces **incorrect results** for binary connective independence checking.

**Key Finding**: Z3's complete binary tree structure cannot represent asymmetric composition patterns when the basis lacks projection functions, causing it to incorrectly claim some sets are independent when they are actually dependent.

**Example**:
- Enumeration correctly finds: max=3 for binary connectives
- Z3 incorrectly claims: max=4 for binary connectives
- Z3's claimed "independent" set is actually dependent

**Root Cause**: Structural limitation in Z3's composition tree encoding.

**Recommendation**: **DO NOT use Z3 for arity ≤3**. Z3 is unreliable for binary/ternary independence checking. Only use Z3 for arity ≥4 where enumeration is impractical, and verify results carefully.

---

## Bug Discovery

### Initial Detection

During Phase 1 baseline validation (Plan 004), comparing Z3 vs enumeration:

| Strategy | Time | Max Size | Correctness |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| **Enumeration** | 0.022s | **3** | ✓ Correct |
| **Z3 SAT** | 3.056s | **4** | ✗ **INCORRECT** |

Z3 claimed the set `['f2_0', 'f2_1', 'f2_3', 'f2_7']` is independent, but enumeration correctly identified it as dependent.

---

## The Bug: Specific Example

### The Connectives

Z3's claimed independent set of size 4:

| Name | Truth Table | Common Name |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| f2_0 | [0,0,0,0] | FALSE (constant) |
| f2_1 | [1,0,0,0] | NOR |
| f2_3 | [1,1,0,0] | NOT y |
| f2_7 | [1,1,1,0] | NAND |

### Enumeration's Analysis

Enumeration correctly identifies that **f2_0 (FALSE) is definable** from the basis `{NOR, NOT y, NAND}`:

| Depth | Definable? |
|-------|------------|
| 1 | Independent |
| 2 | **Definable** |
| 3 | Definable |

**Witness found at depth 2**: `FALSE = NOR(NOT_y(x,y), x)`

### Z3's Incorrect Analysis

Z3 claims f2_0 is independent from the basis at all depths:

| Depth | Z3 Result |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Independent |
| 2 | Independent (WRONG!) |
| 3 | Independent (WRONG!) |
| 4 | Independent (WRONG!) |

**Z3 fails to find the witness** that exists at depth 2.

---

## Witness Verification

### The Missing Witness

Enumeration finds: **FALSE = NOR(NOT_y(x,y), x)**

Verification:

| x | y | NOT_y(x,y) | NOR(NOT_y, x) | Expected | Match |
|---|---|-----------|---------------|----------|-------|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | ✓ |
| 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | ✓ |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ✓ |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | ✓ |

**Witness confirmed**: The formula correctly produces FALSE for all inputs.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Z3's Tree Structure

Z3 uses a **complete binary tree** structure for composition encoding:

**Depth 2 tree**:
```
    Node 0 (root)
     /      \
  Node 1   Node 2
  (leaf)   (leaf)
```

- Node 0: Can be any function from basis
- Node 1: Leaf mapped to input x
- Node 2: Leaf mapped to input y

**Patterns Z3 can represent at depth 2**: `f(x, y)` where f ∈ basis

**Depth 3 tree**:
```
           Node 0
          /      \
      Node 1      Node 2
      /    \      /    \
   Node3  Node4 Node5  Node6
   (leaf) (leaf) (leaf) (leaf)
```

- All leaves at depth 2
- All leaves map to input variables: x, y, x, y (cyclically)

**Patterns Z3 can represent at depth 3**: `f(g(x,y), h(x,y))` where f,g,h ∈ basis

### The Missing Pattern

The witness `NOR(NOT_y(x,y), x)` has an **asymmetric structure**:

```
      NOR (depth 0)
      /        \
  NOT_y (depth 1)   x (depth 0 - direct variable)
  /      \
 x        y
```

This requires:
- Left subtree depth: 2
- Right subtree depth: 1 (direct variable reference)

**Z3 cannot represent this** because:
1. Z3's complete binary tree forces all leaves to the same depth
2. For the right child to output `x`, it would need to be a projection function
3. The basis `{NOR, NOT_y, NAND}` contains no projection functions

### Why Enumeration Succeeds

Enumeration explicitly checks patterns like:
- `f(g(x,y), x)` - one arg is composition, other is direct variable
- `f(g(x,y), y)` - similar asymmetric pattern
- `f(x, g(x,y))` - variable first, composition second

These patterns are **hard-coded** in the enumeration logic (`src/independence.py`), allowing it to find witnesses that Z3's tree structure cannot represent.

---

## Technical Deep Dive

### Z3 Tree Encoding (from `src/independence_z3.py`)

**Tree Construction** (lines 161-230):
```python
def _build_tree_structure(depth: int, max_arity: int = 2):
    # Builds complete binary tree: 2^depth - 1 nodes
    num_nodes = 2 ** depth - 1
    # ...
```

**Leaf Assignment** (lines 336-353):
```python
# For leaf nodes: outputs equal the corresponding input variable
for leaf in leaves:
    leaf_idx = leaves.index(leaf)
    for inp in input_assignments:
        # For binary: first two leaves map to x and y
        var_value = inp[leaf_idx % num_inputs]
```

**Problem**: All leaves are at the same depth and directly represent input variables. No mechanism for asymmetric trees or variable references at shallower depths.

### Enumeration Pattern Checks (from `src/independence.py`)

The enumeration approach includes explicit patterns for asymmetric compositions:

**Depth-2 patterns include** (among others):
- `f(g(x,y), x)` - Composite left, variable right
- `f(x, g(x,y))` - Variable left, composite right
- `f(g(x,y), h(x,y))` - Both composite

This is why enumeration succeeds where Z3 fails.

## Impact Analysis

### Affected Use Cases

**Binary Search** (arity 2):
- Z3 finds max=4 (incorrect)
- Enumeration finds max=3 (correct)
- **Impact**: Z3 produces wrong answer

**Ternary Search** (arity 3):
- Not tested, but likely also affected
- Similar asymmetric patterns probably exist
- **Impact**: Z3 unreliable for ternary

**Quaternary and Higher** (arity ≥4):
- Unknown - not tested
- Z3 may be correct for higher arities
- **Impact**: Uncertain - needs validation

### Correctness Validation

From Phase 7 implementation, we have 159 passing independence tests using enumeration. These tests validate:
- Enumeration correctness for arity ≤3
- Complete coverage of composition patterns
- Proven correct results

Z3 fails these same tests for binary search.

---

## Why Z3 Still Finds *Some* Nice Sets

Z3 found 4 sets of size 4, but why didn't it find size 5 or 6?

The answer: Even with its bug, Z3's encoding still enforces **some** independence constraints correctly. It just misses certain dependency patterns (like asymmetric compositions). So Z3's results are:
- **Not sound**: Claims independence when dependence exists (false negatives)
- **Partially correct**: Still detects some dependencies correctly

This makes the bug **especially dangerous** - Z3 gives plausible-looking results that are subtly wrong.

---

## Comparison with Report 008

Report 008 found: "Z3 is 176× slower than enumeration for binary search"

This report adds: "**Z3 is also incorrect** for binary search"

Combined findings:
1. Z3 is 176× slower ❌
2. Z3 produces wrong results ❌❌
3. **Conclusion**: Never use Z3 for arity ≤3

---

## Proposed Fixes

### Option 1: Fix Z3 Tree Structure (Complex)

Modify Z3 encoding to support asymmetric trees:
- Allow variable references at any depth
- Don't force complete binary trees
- Add "pass-through" nodes that just propagate input variables

**Pros**: Would fix the bug
**Cons**:
- Complex implementation
- May significantly slow down Z3 (more variables/constraints)
- Enumeration still faster anyway

**Recommendation**: Not worth it - enumeration already works

### Option 2: Add Projection Functions to Basis (Workaround)

Include identity/projection functions in every basis:
- `id_x(x,y) = x`
- `id_y(x,y) = y`

Then Z3 could use complete trees:
```
    NOR
   /    \
 NOT_y  id_x
 / \    / \
x   y  x  y
```

**Pros**: Simpler than fixing tree structure
**Cons**:
- Inflates basis size
- Still slower than enumeration
- Not a true fix - just a workaround

**Recommendation**: Not worth it

### Option 3: Abandon Z3 for Low Arities (Recommended)

Simply don't use Z3 for arity ≤3:
- Use enumeration for arity ≤3 (proven correct, 176× faster)
- Only use Z3 for arity ≥4 where enumeration is impractical
- Add strong warnings in code/documentation

**Pros**:
- No code changes to Z3 needed
- Leverages strengths of both approaches
- Aligns with existing adaptive strategy design

**Cons**: None

**Recommendation**: ✅ Implement this immediately

---

## Immediate Actions

### 1. Update Adaptive Strategy

Current (from `src/independence.py`):
```python
def is_definable(target, basis, max_depth=3, use_z3=False):
    if use_z3:
        # Use Z3 SAT encoding
        ...
```

**Recommended**:
```python
def is_definable(target, basis, max_depth=3, use_z3=False):
    # IMPORTANT: Z3 has correctness bugs for arity ≤3
    # Force enumeration for low arities
    if target.arity <= 3 or any(c.arity <= 3 for c in basis):
        use_z3 = False  # Override - Z3 not reliable here

    if use_z3:
        # Use Z3 SAT encoding (only for arity ≥4)
        ...
```

### 2. Add Warnings to Documentation

Update `README.md`, docstrings, and reports with:

```
⚠️ WARNING: Z3 SAT backend has known correctness bugs for arity ≤3.
Do NOT use Z3 for binary or ternary connective independence checking.
Always use pattern enumeration (default) for arity ≤3.
Z3 should only be used for arity ≥4 where enumeration is impractical.
```

### 3. Update Tests

Add test to explicitly check for this bug:
```python
def test_z3_asymmetric_witness_bug():
    """Z3 cannot find asymmetric witnesses without projections."""
    # This test documents the known Z3 bug
    f2_0 = ... # FALSE
    basis = [f2_1, f2_3, f2_7]  # NOR, NOT y, NAND

    # Enumeration finds witness at depth 2
    assert is_definable(f2_0, basis, max_depth=2, use_z3=False) == True

    # Z3 fails to find witness (known bug)
    # We document this failure rather than fixing it
    assert is_definable(f2_0, basis, max_depth=2, use_z3=True) == False  # Bug!
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Validate SMT Results

SMT solvers are powerful but can have subtle bugs. **Always validate** against known correct results or alternative methods.

### 2. Enumeration Has Value

Even though enumeration doesn't scale to high arities, it's:
- Provably correct for low arities
- Much faster (176×)
- Essential for validation

### 3. Tree Structure Matters

The choice of encoding (complete binary trees vs. flexible trees) has major implications for what patterns can be represented.

### 4. Test Coverage is Critical

This bug was caught immediately by Phase 1 baseline validation. Without systematic testing against known results, it could have gone undetected.

---

## Conclusion

Z3's SAT backend has a **critical correctness bug** for binary and ternary connectives due to its complete binary tree structure's inability to represent asymmetric composition patterns.

**Key Findings**:
1. Z3 incorrectly finds max=4 for binary (correct answer: max=3)
2. Z3 fails to find witness `FALSE = NOR(NOT_y(x,y), x)` that exists at depth 2
3. Root cause: Complete binary tree structure cannot represent asymmetric patterns without projection functions
4. Impact: Z3 unreliable for arity ≤3

**Recommendations**:
1. ✅ **Never use Z3 for arity ≤3** - use enumeration (proven correct, 176× faster)
2. ✅ **Add strong warnings** to code and documentation
3. ✅ **Override use_z3=True for low arities** in adaptive strategy
4. ✅ **Add regression test** documenting this bug
5. ⚠️ **Validate Z3 results for arity ≥4** before trusting them

This bug fundamentally changes the conclusions of Plan 004. The study of "Z3 advantages at greater depth/arity" is now:
- **Depth study**: Meaningless - Z3 is incorrect at all depths for binary
- **Arity study**: Still valuable - but to find where Z3 *becomes correct*, not just faster
