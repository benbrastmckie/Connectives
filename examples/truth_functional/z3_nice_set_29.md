**Search Method**: Z3 constraint solving with symmetry breaking
**Verification**: Complete and Independent at depth 3
**Definability Mode**: Truth-functional (clone-theoretic)

## Set Composition

**Size**: 29 connectives
**Arity Distribution**:
- Arity 0 (constants): 1
- Arity 2 (binary): 3
- Arity 3 (ternary): 25

### Connectives in This Set

Found set: `['FALSE', 'CONV_INHIBIT', 'NAND', 'OR', 'f3_33', 'f3_40', 'f3_66', 'f3_77', 'f3_78', 'f3_79', 'f3_84', 'f3_89', 'f3_91', 'f3_102', 'f3_112', 'f3_118', 'f3_129', 'f3_145', 'f3_146', 'f3_154', 'f3_169', 'f3_176', 'f3_183', 'f3_191', 'f3_200', 'f3_207', 'f3_216', 'f3_232', 'f3_244']`

#### Nullary (1 connective)
1. **FALSE** - Always outputs 0

#### Binary (3 connectives)
2. **CONV_INHIBIT** - Converse inhibition: f(x,y) = x ∧ ¬y
3. **NAND** - Not-and: f(x,y) = ¬(x ∧ y)
4. **OR** - Disjunction: f(x,y) = x ∨ y

#### Ternary (25 connectives)
5-29. **f3_33, f3_40, f3_66, f3_77, f3_78, f3_79, f3_84, f3_89, f3_91, f3_102, f3_112, f3_118, f3_129, f3_145, f3_146, f3_154, f3_169, f3_176, f3_183, f3_191, f3_200, f3_207, f3_216, f3_232, f3_244**

Each ternary function has a truth table with 2³ = 8 rows, indexed by their decimal representation (0-255).

## Verification

### Completeness Check

A set is **complete** if it escapes all 5 Post classes. In truth-functional mode:

1. **T₀ (preserves false)**: ✓ Escaped
   - NAND and OR don't preserve false
   - OR(0,0) = 0, but OR(1,0) = 1, etc.

2. **T₁ (preserves true)**: ✓ Escaped
   - FALSE doesn't preserve true
   - FALSE() = 0 ≠ 1 ✓

3. **M (monotone)**: ✓ Escaped
   - CONV_INHIBIT is not monotone
   - CONV_INHIBIT(0,0) = 0 < CONV_INHIBIT(1,0) = 1
   - But CONV_INHIBIT(1,0) = 1 > CONV_INHIBIT(1,1) = 0 ✓

4. **D (self-dual)**: ✓ Escaped
   - FALSE is not self-dual ✓

5. **A (affine/linear)**: ✓ Escaped
   - NAND, OR, and several ternary functions are non-affine ✓

**Result**: Complete ✓

### Independence Check

In **truth-functional mode**, independence is checked with:
- **Universal projection rule**: All projections universally definable
- **Cross-arity constant equivalence**: Constants with same truth value are equivalent
- **Composition-based definability** at depth 3

Each connective was verified to be non-definable from the others using Z3's constraint solving.

**Result**: Independent (truth-functional mode, depth 3) ✓

## Search Performance

- **Complete sets checked**: 904
- **Time to find**: 18.80 seconds
- **Z3 search space reduction**: ~10^70 (vs brute force C(278,29) ≈ 10^72)

### Performance Comparison

| Mode | Time | Sets Checked | Approach |
|------|------|--------------|----------|
| **Truth-Functional** (this file) | 18.80s | 904 | Z3 constraints |
| Syntactic | ~3 minutes | ~50-100 | Z3 constraints |

Truth-functional mode found this size faster, likely due to different symmetry breaking heuristics or search order.

## Key Insights

1. **Truth-functional mode reaches size 29** - Matches syntactic mode's achievement
2. **Ternary dominance**: 86% of the set (25/29) is ternary functions
3. **Multiple binary functions needed**: Unlike size 17, size 29 requires 3 binary functions
4. **Minimal constants**: Still only 1 constant (FALSE) needed
5. **Fast Z3 search**: Found in under 20 seconds despite massive search space

## Mode Comparison

### Truth-Functional vs Syntactic (Size 29)

| Aspect | Truth-Functional (This File) | Syntactic |
|--------|------------------------------|-----------|
| **Achievable?** | ✓ Yes (18.80s) | ✓ Yes (~3min) |
| **Arity distribution** | 1 + 3 + 25 | Similar (exact set varies) |
| **Independence basis** | Universal projections + composition | Composition only |
| **Search time** | Faster (18.80s) | Slower (~3min) |

Both modes can reach size 29, confirming that truth-functional mode's stricter independence checking doesn't prevent achieving large nice sets.

## Significance

### Scientific Value
- **Confirms truth-functional mode scaling**: Can achieve sizes comparable to syntactic mode
- **Large nice set**: 29 connectives is well beyond classical results (max 3 for binary-only)
- **Ternary necessity**: Demonstrates that ternary functions are essential for large sets

### Computational Achievement
- **Efficient search**: Z3 found this in 18.80s from a space of ~10^72 combinations
- **Symmetry breaking effectiveness**: Only checked 904 complete sets before finding nice set
- **Scalability demonstration**: Truth-functional mode handles large search spaces well

## How to Reproduce

```bash
# Using the CLI (truth-functional mode is default)
python -m src.cli prove z3 --target-size 29 --definability-mode truth-functional

# Expected output:
# - Search time: ~15-25 seconds
# - Will find a size-29 nice set (specific set may vary)
# - Complete sets checked: ~500-1500

# Compare with syntactic mode:
python -m src.cli prove z3 --target-size 29 --definability-mode syntactic
# Expected time: ~2-4 minutes
```
