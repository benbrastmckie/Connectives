Arity 3 result: max size = 16
NEW BEST: 16 (was 7)

Example nice set (size 16):
  ['f2_6', 'f3_23', 'f3_43', 'f3_87', 'f3_101', 'f3_116',

   'f3_201', 'f3_226', 'f3_233', 'f3_248']
  (1 binary + 15 ternary functions)

============================================================
FINAL RESULT: Maximum nice set size = 16
============================================================
Composition depth: 3
Strategy: enumeration
Total search time: X.XXs

Key findings:
  - Binary only: max = 3
  - With unary:  max = 7  (133% improvement)
  - With ternary: max = 16 (129% improvement)
  - Theoretical upper bound: 16 (MATCHED!)
