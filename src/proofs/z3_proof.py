Z3-based proof that maximum nice set size = 16.

This approach uses Z3 to encode the constraints and search for
counterexamples (size-17 nice sets). If Z3 returns UNSAT, we have
a formal proof.

Strategy:
1. Encode "set S is complete" as Z3 constraints
2. Encode "set S is independent" as Z3 constraints (challenging)
3. Ask Z3: "Does there exist a size-17 set that is both complete and independent?"
4. If UNSAT → proven that max ≤ 16
5. Combined with size-16 example → max = 16 exactly

Challenges:
- Independence checking via pattern enumeration is procedural
- Need to encode composition patterns as Z3 formulas
- Potentially very large constraint system

Alternative simpler approach:
- Use Z3 for symmetry breaking and smart enumeration
- Keep independence checking procedural
- Let Z3 guide the search efficiently
