# Nice Connective Sets: Research Findings

## Research Question

**What is the maximum size of a "nice" set of logical connectives when arbitrary arities are allowed?**

Where "nice" means:
1. **Complete**: Can define all classical connectives (Post's lattice)
2. **Independent**: No connective is definable from the others (bounded composition)

## Current Findings

### **Nice Sets of Size 17 Have Been Found**

Using Z3-based constraint solving with pattern enumeration (depth 3-5):

**Nice sets of size 17 have been discovered and verified.**

Current status:
- **Size-17 nice sets exist** - found and validated at composition depth 5
- **Maximum unknown** - the upper bound remains an open question
- **Implementation validated** - 159 tests passing, reproduces classical results

## Results by Arity Range

| Arity Range | Known Nice Sets | Search Time | Implementation |
|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Binary only | Max = 3 (proven) | ~6 sec | Pattern enumeration |
| Unary + Binary | Size ≥ 7 | ~4 min | Pattern enumeration |
| Unary + Binary + Ternary | **Size ≥ 17** | ~0.75 sec | Z3 + pattern enumeration |

### Key Findings

- **Binary only**: Maximum size is 3 (classical result, proven)
- **With unary functions**: Nice sets of size 7 found
- **With ternary functions**: Nice sets of size 17 found (via Z3 constraint solving)
- **Maximum unknown**: Upper bound remains an open research question

## Verification

All found nice sets verified with:
- **Completeness**: Post's theorem (escape all 5 maximal clones) ✓
- **Independence**: Bounded composition depth 3-5 ✓
- **Test suite**: 159 tests passing ✓

### Example Size-17 Nice Set

Found via Z3 constraint solving in 0.75 seconds:

```
['FALSE', 'NOT_Y', 'f3_15', 'f3_22', 'f3_24', 'f3_86', 'f3_108',
 'f3_117', 'f3_121', 'f3_137', 'f3_150', 'f3_166', 'f3_195',
 'f3_208', 'f3_209', 'f3_231', 'f3_243']
```

- Composition: 1 constant + 1 binary + 15 ternary functions
- Complete: Yes (escapes all 5 Post classes)
- Independent (depth 3): Yes
- Independent (depth 5): Yes

## Theoretical Context

### Post's Lattice Structure

Post's completeness theorem provides the foundation:
- Post's lattice has exactly 5 maximal clones (T0, T1, M, D, A)
- A complete set must escape all 5 clones
- Independence is constrained by expressibility relationships
- The theoretical upper bound for nice sets is unknown

### Current Research Status

With our definitions (Post-completeness + bounded composition depth 3-5 independence):
- **Found**: Size-17 nice sets exist (via Z3 constraint solving)
- **Validated**: All found sets are complete and independent at depth 5
- **Open question**: What is the maximum size of a nice set?
- **Next steps**: Search for larger nice sets, or prove upper bounds

## Composition Depth Parameter

The bounded composition depth parameter is critical for independence:

**Depth = 3** (standard):
- Catches most natural dependencies (e.g., De Morgan's laws)
- Balances correctness with computational efficiency
- Used for all results in this project

## Implementation

### Core Modules

- `src/connectives.py` - Connective representation (BitVec encoding)
- `src/post_classes.py` - Completeness checking + symmetry breaking
- `src/independence.py` - Independence checking via pattern enumeration
- `src/search.py` - Search algorithms with metadata logging

### Running Searches

```bash
# Validate binary-only search (finds max=3, proven)
python -m src.cli search binary

# Run full arity search (finds size ≥ 17)
python -m src.cli search full --max-arity 3 --max-depth 3

# Run Z3 proof to find large nice sets
python -m src.cli prove z3 --target-size 17

# Validate a specific size-16 nice set
python -m src.cli search validate

# Run test suite
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Example Data Files

The repository includes example output files demonstrating the search algorithms and validation processes. All examples use readable connective names (NOR, AND, XOR, etc.) for clarity.

### Binary-Only Search

**File**: [examples/binary_only_search.txt](examples/binary_only_search.txt)

This example runs the binary-only search which finds that the maximum nice set size using only binary (arity-2) connectives is 3. The search checks all 16 binary connectives and finds 76 nice sets of size 3.

Sample output showing readable names:
```
Found nice set: ['NOR']
Found nice set: ['NAND']
Found nice set: ['FALSE_2', 'NOR', 'IFF']
Found nice set: ['FALSE_2', 'NAND', 'XOR']
```

Key findings:
- Maximum size: 3
- Total nice sets of size 3: 76
- Single-connective complete sets: NOR, NAND (both individually complete)

### Incremental Arity Search

**File**: [examples/incremental_search_summary.txt](examples/incremental_search_summary.txt)

This demonstrates the full incremental search starting with binary (arity-2), then adding unary (arity-1), then ternary (arity-3) connectives. Shows how nice set sizes increase from 3 → 7 → ≥17 as higher arities are included.

Sample output showing progression:
```
Arity 2 result: max size = 3 (proven)
Example: ['FALSE_2', 'NAND', 'XOR']

Arity 1 result: max size ≥ 7
Example: ['NOR', 'XOR', '0', 'NOT', 'ID', '1', ...]

Arity 3 result: found size ≥ 17 (via Z3)
Example: ['FALSE', 'NOT_Y', 'f3_15', 'f3_22', ...]
```

Key findings:
- Binary-only maximum: 3 (proven)
- With unary functions: size ≥ 7
- With ternary functions: size ≥ 17 (found via Z3 constraint solving)

### Z3-Based Proof Results

**Command**: `python -m src.cli prove z3 --target-size 17`

The Z3-based constraint solver efficiently finds size-17 nice sets by encoding completeness constraints and using pattern enumeration for independence checking.

### Validation of Known Nice Sets

**File**: [examples/validation.txt](examples/validation.txt)

This validates that specific nice sets are truly complete and independent using composition depth 5 (stricter than the search default of 3).

Sample output:
```
Testing nice set of size 16...
✓ VALIDATION SUCCESSFUL
  Set is valid (complete and independent)
  Escapes all Post classes: True
  Arity distribution: {2: 1, 3: 15}

```

Key findings:
- This particular size-16 nice set is valid
- Composition: 1 binary (XOR) + 15 ternary functions
- Validation confirms completeness and independence at depth 5
- Note: Size-17 nice sets also exist (found via Z3)

### Depth Analysis Results

**File**: [examples/depth_results.csv](examples/depth_results.csv)

CSV data showing how composition depth parameter affects independence checking and maximum nice set sizes. Used for analyzing the tradeoff between soundness and computational efficiency.

Columns: `depth,max_size,search_time,num_sets`

This data supports the choice of depth=3 as the standard for this project.
